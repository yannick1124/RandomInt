# RandomInt
Don't worry. Use it, copy it, re-upload it. It's mine but too easy to put my name on.

### Instructions:
  - To call it, call `randomInt(min,max);`.
  - `min` is the lowest possible value and `max` is the value it will never reach.
That's it! I built it to make randomize easier and it worked.

### To use this library, paste this into your HTML code:
```HTML

```
